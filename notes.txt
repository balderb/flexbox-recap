Grid and Flexbox work well together. 
And floats are not totally away now.

Flexbox is really great when you want to line things up in one direction.

Think of it as a bunch of boxes that are in an infintely long line but it's
not infinately long. It's actually a limited amount of space so it happens to wrap.
Whether it wraps or not, the calculations that are being made are all one line
at a time. The browser only thinks about things in one dimension at a time. it 
does not calculate information across rows. or if you go in the other direction.
It will calculate them in one direction and not in the other direction.

Grid has the ability to line things up in two directions. And in fact, Grid always wants
to line things up in two directions. you can't get it to kind of stagger things. It
thinks about rows and columns at the same time, and it's gonna wanna make adjustments to your
grid, based on what's going on in both of those directions at the same time.

We can also use Grid and Flexbox all at the same time.

Learn css grid more specifically.
But we can use flexbox and grid together.

-> What is the main tag again?

The HTML <main> element represents the dominant content of the <body> of a document.
